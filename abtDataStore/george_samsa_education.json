      "description": "A five-year Ph.D. program focusing on the development and application of advanced lighting technologies aimed at improving energy efficiency in commercial spaces. The research encompassed solid-state lighting, smart lighting systems, and the integration of IoT in lighting solutions. The program included courses in photonics, electrical systems, sustainable design, and smart technologies. Gregor Samsa's dissertation presented novel approaches to reduce energy consumption in commercial lighting, resulting in significant cost savings and environmental benefits. The Ph.D. program required the rigorous formulation on mathematical models that were solved using numerical computer methods, such as Monte Carlo simulations, gradient-descent and pseudo-second order methods, including a novel approach developed by George Samsa. The work was presented to a wide range of audiences, including engineering audiences as well as lighting and interior design audiences. George Samsa was an invited speaker at Medical Spaces Illumination Design Society, where he presented his work to great acclaim to an audience with modest to no mathematical education. Additionally, he was involved in several collaborative projects with industry partners and taught undergraduate courses in electrical engineering and sustainable technologies. He was voted the best teaching assistant in the department of electrical engineering for three consecutive years. His work was recognized with several awards, including the prestigious 'Innovator of the Year' award from the Czech Society of Electrical Engineers."

      "year_conclude": "2004",
      "month_conclude": "June",
      "description": "A four-year program emphasizing a strong foundation in mechanical engineering principles with a focus on energy systems, materials science, and industrial automation. Courses included thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, materials engineering, control systems, and renewable energy technologies. Gregor Samsa's coursework was complemented by extensive project work in designing energy-efficient mechanical systems. Extracurricular activities included participation in engineering competitions and a deep interest in the history of technology and industrial design. He assisted fellow students in biology to develop a laboratory device to facilitate the controlled growth of insects for research purposes. His master thesis, titled 'Light-Emitting Diodes as Means to Interior Harmony in Crammed Residential Spaces', explored through formal mathematical optimization the use of LED lighting to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of small living spaces. The thesis was well-received by the faculty and led to further research opportunities in the field of lighting design. Gregor Samsa graduated with honors and was awarded the 'Freud-Boltzmann Top Thesis in Mechanical Engineering' prize for his innovative work."
