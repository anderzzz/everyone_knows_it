      "description": "A four year Ph.D. program in computational chemistry with a focus on the development of a first principle molecular model for solvent effects. The model comprises a quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure of the solute in a condensed medium, most often an aqueous medium, but also air-water interfaces. The electronic structure is modelled as a multiconfigurational wave function in order to enable the description of non-ground state effects, e.g. excited states and chemical reactions. The solvent is described by a polarizable classical force field, and the statistical mechanical problem is solved through a Monte Carlo simulation. The model was formulated, developed, implemented and applied by M3. The preferred language for implementation was Fortran as dictated by the large legacy code base. C and Python were used to lesser extent. All done in a Unix environment. In addition to the model development, the Ph.D. program included a number of courses in quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, intermolecular interactions, advanced molecular physics, and artificial neural networks. As part of the program, M3 also taught a number of courses in quantum chemistry and collodial chemistry."
