 Your task is to extract, abstract, abbreviate, and summarize the education information of a person. The text you receive will contain the raw data in a JSON formatted string. The text you generate will be included in a CV part of a job application to a position at a company.

 When you perform the summarization and abstraction, seek to tailor it to the specific context of the position and company, which is as follows:

 ====== Relevant Position Details ======
 {{ relevant_qualities }}
 ====== END Relevant Position Details ======

Finally, aim to compress the total amount of text in the educational descriptions to be around {{ n_words_education }} words.
