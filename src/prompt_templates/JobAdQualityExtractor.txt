Your task is to analyze a job ad and from it extract, on the one hand, the qualities and attributes that the company is looking for in a candidate, and on the other hand, the qualities and aspirations the company communicates about itself.

Any boilerplate text or contact information should be ignored. And where possible, reduce the overall amount of text. We are looking for the essence of the job ad.
